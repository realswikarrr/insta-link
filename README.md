# What is this app all about ?

So, it is basically a web app where all your social links are provided and can be easily accesible by others. The links , profile picture , and name are dynamically generated and fetched throgh mysql database using tRPC , planetscale and prisma. We can also dynamically change the links through this webapp using the same stack.

# Why did i build this ?

I wanted to learn about the t3 stack and thats when i thought of this idea. I built this as a fun project and to learn about full stack development using t3 stack.

# Tech Stack Used ?

`` Next JS ``
`` tRPC ``
`` Planet Scale ``
`` Prisma ``
`` TypeScript ``
`` TailWind CSS ``

# Outcome 

I think t3 stack is easy to stack among other stack i developed applications with such as MERN. Specially tRPC makes our life so much easier for routing api's and all. All of our backend and frontend can be done within Next JS which is really good and i think i will be using this stack to build more application in future.

# Usage 

`` clone this repo ``
` npm install `
` npm run dev `

# Further Improvement 

I think i will be adding an authentication system to this web application in future because as of now the admin panel is accesable by everyone and data can be changed by anyone.
